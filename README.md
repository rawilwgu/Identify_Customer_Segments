Moving through preprocessing sections, then building a machine learning model.

# Overview

In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. Throughout this project, we look at the relationships between demographic features, then divide the dataset into specific clusts. We then analyze those clusters to determine the best customer features to market towards.

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree certification, through Western Governors University.

# Objectives

Apply unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. Preprocess the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and implement clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.

# Data Origin

 The files used in the project:

    Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv : Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
    Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv : Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
    Data_Dictionary.md : Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
    AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv : Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.
    Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook divided into sections and guidelines for completing the project. The notebook provides more details and tips than the outline given here.
